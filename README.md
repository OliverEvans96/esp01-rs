# Esp01

Crate for communicating with the esp01 variant of the esp8266 wifi module using
the embedded hal traits.

For now the crate is a bit barebones, for example, only running as a client and
sending TCP/UDP messages is supported. For now, it is not very well tested. It
should work fine, but don't rely on it without doing your own testing. If you
do end up using it, let me know how well it works!
